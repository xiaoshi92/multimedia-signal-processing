# multimedia-signal-processing
This GitHub is dedicated to interesting Multimedia Signal Processing, which includes mostly multimedia formats in audio and vision. Here, linear and nonlinear regression models are used to understand contextual images such as image recognition, object detection (i.e., recognition of objects within an image), image segmentation, and the latest generative deepnet models
